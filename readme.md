<h2>What is ZN</h2>

<p>
The basic principle of ZN Framework is to let users write simple and readable codes. Because of this principle, our libraries are built by using both dynamic and static access methods with a Powerful Autoloading Architecture.

In general, we have tried to stay on PSR coding standards but at same points our vision made us to stay away on some of them.

Development of ZN Framework with the principle of SIMPLICITY grows each day further. We give importance of Developers for not forced to use different structures from 3rd party sources while developing and integrating structures.

Our aim is to make ZN Framework users doesn't require any other additional structures.
